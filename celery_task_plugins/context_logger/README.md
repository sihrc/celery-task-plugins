### Context Logger Plugin

Adding context in the logs for celery. For example, adding a user ID to tasks that were created on behalf of a specific user.
The design of this plugin is still a work in progress.

### TODO
 - [ ] Figure out how to turn off the default logging we see in stdout from celery worker
